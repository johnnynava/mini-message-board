Work in progress but in this small full-stack project there's two pages

In the second page (/new) you are able to add messages and then it redirects you to the main page where you can see your message

I did this in Typescript, the files required to run this are inside the dist directory.

Technologies used:
• Typescript
• Node.js
• Express.js
• EJS
